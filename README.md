# Simple-Memory-Manager

This project was developed as a school assignment for course Data Structures and Algorithms (FIIT STU). The point of this project was to create a simple memory management tool without using the built in functions of C language (Init, Alloc, Check and Free). This project is written entirely in C language and was developed without using any external sources. User interface, code and code comments are written in English.
